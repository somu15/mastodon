# A MOOSE-Based Application class=center style=clear:both;font-weight:200;font-size:200%

MASTODON is built on the MOOSE framework and can efficiently solve problems using standard
workstations or very large high-performance computers in different dimensions, including full 3D, 2D,
2D-RZ axisymmetric, layered 1D, and spherical 1D systems. Code reliability is paramount for the MOOSE
framework, and MOOSE-based applications. MASTODON therefore employs a well-defined development and
testing strategy in which, code changes are only merged into the repository after both a manual code
review and an automated regression test have been completed.

MASTODON is developed by the Facility Risk Group at the [Idaho National Laboratory](http://inl.gov) by a team of computational scientists and structural and earthquake engineers, and is supported by various funding agencies including the [United States Department of Energy](http://energy.gov).
