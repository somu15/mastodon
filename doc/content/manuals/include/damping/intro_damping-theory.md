## Damping id=damping

When the soil-structure system (including both soil and concrete)
responds to an earthquake excitation, energy is dissipated in two primary
ways: (1)small-strain and hysteretic material damping, and (2) damping due to gapping,
sliding and uplift at the soil-foundation interface. Dissipation of
energy due to item (1) is modeled (approximately) using following methods: (i) viscous damping for small strain damping experienced at very small strain
levels ($\gamma$ $\leq 0.001 \%$) where the material behavior is largely linear viscoelastic; (ii)
hysteretic damping due to nonlinear hysteretic behavior of the material.
Dissipation of energy due to (2) is discussed in the foundation-soil interface section. This section discusses the damping that is present at small strain levels.
